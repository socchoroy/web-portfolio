    <h3>World Class Proffesional Web Developer</h3>
    <p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications.</p>

  <h1>Dream Big</h1>
  <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
  <p>So as I drifted from job to job gaining valuable & diverse experience, I still managed to squeeze in a few web-design related projects into the mix. Whether it was a new website for the company I worked for, or building them an intranet, or updating their existing one, even volunteering to manage my churchs website, I managed to keep the web design dream somewhat alive.

    But over the years I failed to keep up to date with new standards and web design tools and I found myself falling farther and farther behind in the industry. I thought the wonderful world of web design had passed me by.</p>
